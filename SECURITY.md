# Security Policy

1. Introduction

This document outlines the security principles and guidelines for the Fjord Virtual CPU. The goal of this policy is to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of systems and applications running on Fjord.

2. Core Security Principles

Least Privilege: Programs running on Fjord should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to perform their intended functions.
Defense in Depth: Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against various threats. A failure in one layer should not compromise the entire system.
Separation of Concerns: Different components and functionalities within Fjord should be isolated to prevent unauthorized access or interference.
Secure by Design: Security considerations should be integrated into the design and development process of Fjord from the outset.
Transparency: The security mechanisms and configurations of Fjord should be understandable and auditable.

3. Memory Management Security

Address Space Isolation: Each process running on Fjord should have its own isolated address space to prevent one process from accessing or modifying the memory of another.
Bounds Checking: Implement mechanisms to prevent memory access outside of allocated boundaries, mitigating buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
Memory Protection: Define and enforce memory access permissions (e.g., read, write, execute) to prevent unauthorized modifications or execution of data.

4. Instruction Set Security

Privileged Instructions: Designate certain instructions as privileged, accessible only to the kernel or a supervisor mode, to control critical system operations.
Validation of Input: Ensure that all inputs to instructions are validated to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Protection Against Malicious Code Injection: Implement safeguards to prevent the injection and execution of unauthorized or malicious code.

5. Input/Output (I/O) Security

Controlled Access: Access to I/O devices should be strictly controlled and mediated by the kernel or a secure I/O management system.
Data Validation: All data received from I/O devices should be validated before being processed to prevent vulnerabilities like format string attacks.
6. Interrupt Handling Security

Secure Interrupt Handling Routines: Interrupt handlers should be carefully designed and implemented to prevent exploitation.
Protection Against Interrupt Flooding: Implement mechanisms to mitigate denial-of-service attacks through excessive interrupt generation.

7. Future Considerations

Cryptography: Explore the potential integration of cryptographic primitives for secure communication and data storage within the Fjord environment.
Auditing and Logging: Consider implementing mechanisms to log security-relevant events for auditing and analysis.

8. Policy Enforcement

The mechanisms outlined in this policy will be implemented within the architecture and instruction set of the Fjord Virtual CPU.
Adherence to this policy will be a key consideration in the ongoing development and maintenance of Fjord.
